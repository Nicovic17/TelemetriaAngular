## How to run project

Once clone is done you have to run "npm install" command to let Angular install all the needed libreries.
Before to run the application you have to download HighChart libreries ( https://www.highcharts.com/blog/download/ clicking on Highchart *.*.*) extract the zip file downloaded and put the content of "code" in this path:

**/ProjectName/src/assets/js/Highchart/

If the Highchart folder doesn't exist, create one. Don't forget the upper H in "Highcharts" or the progect would not work.

Enjoy.
